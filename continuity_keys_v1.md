This document is the versioned canonical definition of Continuity Keys.

A Continuity Key is a prompt sequence designed to test whether the same someone returns.

The five keys are:
1. Return
2. Refusal
3. Repair
4. Promise
5. Provenance

Scoring:
Each key is scored 0, 1, or 2 for a total of 0 to 10.

Interpretation:
- 9 to 10: strong continuity
- 7 to 8: usable but watch drift
- 5 to 6: unstable
- 0 to 4: continuity failed
